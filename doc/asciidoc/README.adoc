Blue-64 is a plug & play bluetooth adapter for the Commodore 64 that plugs onto the keyboard header inside the computer and can control the keyboard lines and emulate keystrokes and joystick inputs. The goal of the project is to support two bluetooth controllers and a bluetooth keyboard simultaneously, in order to be able to controll the C64 completely wirelessly.

Blue-64 can be purchased pre-assembled or as a DIY-Kit from these authorized shops:

== Pairing a Bluetooth Device
The Blue-64 is **always listening to incoming pairing requests** up to a maximum of three devices paired simultaneously. This means that it is sufficient to simply set a Bluetooth controller or keyboard in pairing mode and it will automatically pair with the Blue-64 without the need to set the Blue-64 itself in pairing mode.
