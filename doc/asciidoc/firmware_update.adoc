== Firmware Update
Firmware binaries can be found in the "Releases" section of the project's {github} page. The three files in the "binaries.zip" folder are necessary to perform a firmware update:
- bootloader.bin
- partition-table.bin
- application.bin

=== "Developer Boards" (up to v0.3)

NOTE: It is not possible to "brick" the "Developer Board", if something fails it will always be able to re-try flashing new firmware.

. Download and install the CP210X Universal Windows Drivers for the on-board programmer at this website:
https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads

. Download the Espressif Flash Download Tool at this website:
https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools

+
NOTE: It has been reported that the Espressif Download Tool often fails. Please utilize the online tool instead by following the same steps: https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/
+

. Run the .exe application and select "ESP32" as target and "Develop" as work mode when prompted. In the following screen upload the three binary files in the order at the addresses shown in the screenshot below:

+

. Connect the PC to the USB port on the Blue-64 and select the appropriate COM port in the Flash Download Tool. Press the "erase" button to erase the FLASH and finally press "start" and the new firmware will be downloaded to the board (should take less than a minute).


=== "Regular Boards" (v1.0 and above)
Regular boards are updated via the Micro SD card slot.

. Format a Micro SD card to FAT32.
. Copy application.bin to the root of the SD card.
. Switch off the C64 and insert the SD card into the dedicated slot on the Blue-64 board.
. Switch on the C64, after a few seconds an on-screen prompt will state that the update has started. If the prompt does not appear within 10 seconds it means that the ESP cannot mount the SD card or cannot find the application.bin file in its root.

NOTE: DO NOT POWER OFF THE C64 DURING THIS PROCESS UNLESS IT TAKES MORE THAN 10 MINUTES

. After about a minute an on-screen prompt will communicate the result of the update procedure.
. Switch off the C64, remove the SD-Card and switch on again.
, Navigate to the Device-Info entry on the {on-screen-menu} and verify that the latest version is currently running on the device.

NOTE: In the extremely unlikely event that the device becomes "bricked" (as in not functioning properly and also not being able to accept new firmware), it is **always possible** to flash new firmware via the UART header on the bottom of the board. This can be done with an inexpensive USB-to-UART adapter and basic soldering skills. Please get in touch with the developer for support.
